- **CSS**: For styling the weather card and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API and dynamically updates the DOM.
- **OpenWeather API**: Used for retrieving real-time weather data.


## How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites
- A code editor like **VSCode**.
- A basic understanding of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- **Node.js** (optional) for running a local server.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate** into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser:
   You can either double-click the `index.html` file or use a live server extension in VSCode (if you're using it).

4. **Add your API Key**:
   - Sign up for a free API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api).
   - Replace the `apiKey` value in the script section of `index.html` with your API key:
     ```javascript
     const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
     ```

### Usage
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter the name of a city in the search box.
3. Click the **search button** to retrieve the current weather for that city.
4. If the city name is invalid, the app will display an error message.
